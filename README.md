<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Plots][product-screenshot]]()
[![HeatMap][product-screenshot-2]]()

Here is a basic repository of all the directed and praticed missions we did during the first master degree year of machine learning in Nantes' University.

### Built With

* [Python 3.0](https://www.python.org/)
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

Here is a list of the Python library we used :

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* [Plotly](https://plot.ly/)
* [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/)


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Content

### TP1 : Naive Bayes, text preprocessing

Dataset : Users opinion (commentary and rate from 1 to 5) related to a course, see the csv file "/TP1/reviews_by_course.csv"


Aim : 

* Open a CSV file from pandas.
* Quickly explore data with basic pandas function.
* Learn how to process words using two approach (bag of words (hot encoder), TF-IDF) using Sklearn.
* Learn how to implements a Naive Bayes model (Multinomial) in order to predict classification (the rate of the user) using Sklearn.
* Learn to adjust model parameters.
* Learn how to calculate and read results indicators.
* Learn how to draw line-chart, standard deviation-chart using Plotly.

--> TF-IDF maybe need to be corrected (be careful about results)

--> need to play with more parameters than alpha


### TP2 : Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression

Dataset : 

* Multivalued indicators related to candidate chances of admission, see the csv file "/TP2/admissiondata.csv"
* Multivalued indicators related to house's environnement with their price, see [Load Boston](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html)


Aim : 

* Work with google colab, basic import functions and directory management.
* Open a CSV file from pandas.
* Quickly explore data with basic pandas function.
* Pre-processing datas with pandas, numpy.
* Learn how to understand Correlation Matrix (you can see an other repository nammed [Data Analysis Project](https://github.com/camilleAmaury/R_data_analysis_project) for more detailled statistics).
* Learn how to implements a Linear Regression using Sklearn.
* Learn how to calculate and read results indicators.
* Learn how to implements a Gradient Boosting Regression using Sklearn.
* Learn how to calculate and read results indicators.
* Learn how to draw heathmap, scatterplot using Seaborn.
* Learn how to draw barplot using Matplotlib.


### TP3 : Decision Tree

Dataset : 

* Multivalued indicators related to people's rating on movies, see the csv file "/TP3/movies.csv"

Aim : 

* Work with google colab, basic import functions and directory management.
* Open a CSV file from pandas.
* Quickly explore data with basic pandas function.
* Pre-processing datas with pandas, numpy.
* Learn how to understand Confusion Matrix.
* Learn how to implements a Decision Tree using Sklearn.
* Learn how to calculate and read results indicators.


### DataMining - TP2 : Basic process of the machine learning

Dataset : 

* Multivalued indicators related to people's bank crediting, see the csv file "/DataMining/TP2/german.data"

Aim : 

* Work with google colab, basic import functions and directory management.
* Open a CSV file from pandas.
* Quickly explore data with basic pandas function.
* Pre-processing datas with pandas, numpy.
* Learn how to understand Confusion Matrix.
* Learn how to implements a Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN using Sklearn.
* Learn how to implements a Grid Search in order to do fine-tuning.
* Learn how to implements a Cross-Validation rather than simple validation.
* Learn how to calculate and read results indicators.


### Probabilist Model - Backward, Forward :

Dataset : 

see the file "/ProbabilisticModel/PM_Vitterbi_Forward_Backward.html"

Aim : 

* Implements Backward and Forward algorithm with python for PFA.
